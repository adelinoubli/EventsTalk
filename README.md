# EventsTalk

Hello

 I was a little rushed to finish the assignment,  therefore i skipped the event detail part in order to get the local storage done.

Therefore, once the events list is retrieved, the first 3 elements are being stored in local, these elements are shown after clicking the dedicated the bottom navigation bar button.

( I got internet issues in the meantime )
Thanks.
